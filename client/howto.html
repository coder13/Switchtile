	<h2>Accounts:</h2>
	<p>The login button also acts a sign up button. Just type in your username and password and play.<br>
	If you don't create an account, your times will be saved locally. If you do make an account, your times will be saved on a server and you can participate in the leaderboards.</p>

<div>
	<h2>The game:</h2>
	<p>You start with the solved state, and clicking scramble or pressing space will scramble. If you click shift+space, it will scramble but won't time.<br>
	There are 2 different control schemes: either clicking and draging the tiles, or hovering over the tile with your mouse and using the WASD keys to move it.</p>
